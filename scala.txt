RDD - lazy evaluation
immutable parallel colln of objects exposed with lambda functions
being in memory, rdds involve overhead of GC 

DF - is an abstraction which gives a schema view of data
2 features - custom mem mgmt(data stored in offheap mem, no GC) - optimized execn plans

flatMap return list of elements
Map return one element
